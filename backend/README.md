# Backend for the Bright Light webapp

This is the backend for the Bright Light web app.

It is a REST API built with Koa to serve the needs of the frontend.

## First development

Development is done purely on an MVP super basic basis. When it starts to get more complex, I'll see if we need
to use a more complex framework and refactor the code to be more enterprisey.

The more complex the framework, the more resources we will need in the server to process requests.
