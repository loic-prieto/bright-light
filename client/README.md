# Bright Light Web Client

Bright light, at least initially, is implemented as a web client, which allows to reduce dev efforts and an easy distribution/update of the application. 

This is an SPA application implemented with Angular. Angular was chosen because it is very easy to build a full application with it, being a well structured framework.

Check the milestones document to see the expected development milestones for this application.
