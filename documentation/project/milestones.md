# Milestones

## Milestone Alpha 1

* We can open the web app locally
* we can create a band
* we can manage units in a band: 
  * edit name and description
  * remove unit
  * add unit from in-memory fake catalogue
* the project is set up with a strong foundation to minimise future development friction

## Milestone Alpha 2

* User can select a catalogue from a BS Dataset deployed in the server
* A band can be created based on the information found in the BS dataset for the far future setting
* A band can be saved and loaded to/from a local computer
* Units can be distributed in groups

## Milestone Alpha 3

* The datasets can be loaded by the webapp from a backend service without the user having to upload it
* The backend has different versions of the datasets stored and fetchable

## Milestone Alpha 4

* The rules engine is designed and a prototype implemented with a fake set of rules

## Milestone Beta 1

* A band can be created fully with the dataset of the emotionally restrained space fairies, with rules validations

## Milestone Beta 2

* Simpler factions are added to the list of available bands with full rule validation

## Milestone Beta 3

* One of the complex factions is implemented. The robotic zealots may be one it

## Milestone Beta 4

* All the rules supporting all the factions are now implemented 

## Milestone Beta 5

* The development pipeline allows creating and updating the hosting infrastructure

## Milestone release 1.0.0

* The web app is available publicly under its own domain
* a band can be created based on a dark universe far in the future dataset compatible with BS data sets
* All available factions in that dataset should be usable
* A band can be saved in the user's computer
* a band can be loaded from a file in the user's computer
